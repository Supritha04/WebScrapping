Last time, UDF bagged 19 out of 20 seats because the people of Kerala didn't want the BJP to get into power again, and INC was the best bet to avoid vote scattering. But since INC and Rahul Gandhi failed to even form a strong opposition, people might just vote for LDF and UDF almost equally. I myself prefer the LDF.\n",
